This will not work currently since Krampus removed their WebSocket and loader.live now redirects to acedia.gg, i will try to fix this ui once krampus implements their local WebSocket.

How to use:\
&emsp;&emsp;Go to https://loader.live/dashboard, log in and copy your login token.\
&emsp;&emsp;Start up the program and Enter you login token in the login window.\
&emsp;&emsp;Click on the Inject icon and select your Krampus/Ro-Exec exe.
